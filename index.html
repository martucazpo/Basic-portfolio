            My name is Marco. I currently work at The Blue Willow as a prep cook.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also worked in home health care and as a barber.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I am looking to do something else, something that requires both creativity and attention to detail.            
        </p>
        <p>
            As I child I enjoyed working on jigsaw puzzles; sifting through the pieces and making the picture slowly come together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coding feels the same way to me, piecing different elements together to make a whole, resplendant on a computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps I retain a sense of wonder, like many of my generation, because although we grew up in an era with electricity, many of today's commonplace conveniences would have been unimaginable to me as a child.
        </p>
        <p>
            I look forward to  the future and the new wonders I might encounter.
